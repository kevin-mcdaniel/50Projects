# 50 Projects in 50 Days

This is the repository for the Udemy course [50 Projects in 50 Days, HTML, CSS and JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?kw=50+projects&src=sac) by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop.

I've found that some of these projects aren't done as correctly as they should be and I hope to revist them and update them after I've finished the course.
